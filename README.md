# PoETrade Redesign
Unofficial redesign for the official Path of Exile trade website.

## Overview

This is just a few design changes to the PoE trade website to make it easier to use for now until GGG updates it in the future.

**This will probably stop working when design changes are made by GGG, but uninstalling is as easy as removing the CSS file later on**.

## Installation

### Automatic

1. Install a stylesheet manager (used to put the CSS on the page).
    - [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) on Firefox or [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) on Firefox.
    - [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en) on Chrome.
2. Go to the style you with to use:
    - Vertical style: https://userstyles.org/styles/150636/poe-trade-revamped-vertical
    - Grid style:  https://userstyles.org/styles/150637/poe-trade-revamped-grid
3. Click on the **Install Style** button on the website.
4. Browse to https://www.pathofexile.com/trade to use!

### Manual

1. Open your favourite stylesheet manager in your browser (I used Stylus on Firefox, Stylish on Chrome).
2. Create a new style and paste in either the `poetrade_grid.css` file or the `poetrade_vertical.css` file found on this repository.
3. Limit the domains to apply only to **URLs on the domain** `pathofexile.com` so that the CSS only affects the PoE trade website.

## Removal

1. Go to your stylesheet manager (Stylish or Stylus) and delete the stylesheet installed (should be called **PoE Trade Revamped - Vertical** or **PoE Trade Revamped - Grid**).
2. Uninstall your stylesheet manager if you no longer wish to use it.
